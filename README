Bundle::LWP5_837 0.01

Bundle listing just LWP version 5.837

LWP version 6 requires perl 5.8.8 or higher.  If your  modules  still
run on 5.8.7 or lower and you want installation to be  seamless,  you
can use this single-distribution bundle to install the  previous  ver-
sion (5.837) on older perls.

Just put something like this in your Makefile.PL:

  ...
  PREREQ_PM => {
    $] < 5.008008 && !eval{require LWP} ? ( 'Bundle::LWP5_837' => 0 )
                                        : (  LWP               => 0 )
  }
  ...
